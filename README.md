# VueJS Task Tracker

Crash course from Brad Traversy. I am pushing the files even though I wan tto go back and add "_proper_" CSS files as opposed to using `style` tags. I'm also going to remove the Reminder toggle functionality in preference for adding the `contenteditable` attribute.

I'm calling it because trying to run a server and a backend is killing my computer. I'm going to push when before and after he refactors the code.

> NOT WORKING - check his code becasue the tasks are not being loading on the page or in db.json and delete doesn't work
